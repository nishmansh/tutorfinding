                        The services of Takhti are very helpful. We found a very good physics teacher through your
                        website. I have already recommended the same to many of my friends. Thanks to you once again and
                        keep the good work going.

                        I am very thankful to your site, I was looking at many sites which can provide tutor contacts
                        but I was not happy with it,but through your site, I am able to find the right tutor for me. I got a
                        good tutor who solved my problems which I used to face in exams. I am really thankful
